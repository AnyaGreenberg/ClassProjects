# ModelingSatelliteDNA
The main objective of this independent research was to investigate whether the copy number distribution of repeats in a simulated population could provide insights about the evolution process, specifically about the recombination rate. I used clustering and regression models to discover where information about the recombination rate could be found in empirical data. This research project was done on populations simulated using the Stephan model of evolution due to the lack of informative real-world data available. My results indicated that, in order to find substantial evidence for a recombination rate, I would need to look beyond copy number distribution.
